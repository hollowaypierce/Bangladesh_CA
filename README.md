# Investigating Cropland Abandonment Drivers in Bangladesh

While I am still in the initial data collection and cleaning phase I have had the pleasure of working alongside two PhD candidates at UNC on analyzing drivers behind Cropland Abandonment in Bangladesh.

Our dependent varible for analysis, Cropland Abaondment, is sourced from a comprehensive raster analysis conducted by the [Global Cropland Analysis & Discovery Lab](https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/croplands). Their datasets provide a valuable window into understanding the sptial change of cropland dynamics worldwide in the 21st century.

Our paper is currently still in the intial draft phase but below are intial data visualizations I created for our study, showing the various data sources we are working with.
